## Test Data

### test_data_march4
This is data collected with the controller_nano.ino sketch and collect_data.ipynb
All trials are 10 s long, 100 Hz collection speed, for 1000 total data points. The reference input is 100 mbar in all trials.

Pump 1:
* Trials 12-18 (single-bladder)
* Trials 19-25 (double-bladder)

Pump 2:
* Trials 0-4 (single-bladder)
* Trials 5-10 (double-bladder) (I think I noticed that some of these are bumpy, which might want to be discarded)

Note: not sure what happened with Trial 11, but do not use.
